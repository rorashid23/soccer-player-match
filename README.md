# soccer-player-match
Designed a web page to display information on soccer players, what team they are on, and matches between teams using React and a database stored using AWS.
Features include different pages for players, matches, and teams with the ability to sort each list and filter based on a search query.
Boilerplate code given was the Initial setup of player page, matches page, and teams page
I had connected the database to their respective pages, and performed the desired queries for each desired action, such as filtering searches, sorting.
I had created columns to correctly display data unique to each team, player, and match
Additionally, I had created a visual diagram to display different attributes for each player, depending on whether or not they are a goalkeeper.
The database is dependent on the free trial of Amazon Web Services, and is stopped at the moment due to the constraints of the AWS trial. Therefore, the data will not display unless this database is activated again.
